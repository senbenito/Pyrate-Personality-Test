    <h2 class="wtf">OK, dude... you've got some explaining to do.</h2>
    <section id="explain">
      Congratulations, you've been duped by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect">Barnum Effect.</a>

      <p>Named for the infamous showman and circus entertainer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._T._Barnum">P.T. Barnum</a>, who claimed, "there's a sucker born every minute," the Barnum Effect is a common psychological phenomenon where suckers, *ahem* victims, believe a vague and general description, when rooted in some widely accepted authority - <strong>especially if complimentary</strong> - are accurate descriptions of themselves. Think of fortune-tellers and horoscopes...</p>

      <p>Here's the article I originally read that started me down this path of pulling the wool over your eyes: <a href="https://curiosity.com/topics/the-barnum-effect-is-why-this-article-knows-exactly-what-kind-of-person-you-are-curiosity/">Curiosity.com/TheBarnumEffect</a>.</p>

        <li>My amusement...</li>
        <li>To warn you...</li>
        <li>So that we can take advantage of this psychology when designing killer UX in g[49] and beyond...</li>
        <li>But, mostly for <strong>FUN</strong> <img id="pirateEmoji" src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/cute-pirate-emoji-tease-emotion-put-out-tongue-emoticon-cartoon-style-vector-illustration-smile-icon-80888034.jpg">!!</li>
